# 0.4.1 / 2015-12-13

**Fixed:**

- Bad npm package for 0.4.0 - npm was reading the new `files` config from `package.json` in templates for React components/web modules and applying it when packing nwb itself for publishing.

# 0.4.0 / 2015-12-11

**Added:**

- Added `--fallback` option to `nwb serve`, for serving the index page from any path when developing React apps which use the HTML5 History API [[#16](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/16)]
- Added `"engines": {"node": ">=4.0.0"}` to `package.json` - nwb accidentally depends on this because it uses [qs](https://github.com/hapijs/qs) v6 - if it's a problem for you, please create an issue [[#19](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/19)]
- Added `files` config to React component/web module `package.json` templates.
  - The `files` config for the React component template assumes that components published to npm with `require()` calls for CSS which ships with it will use a `css/` dir.
- Added a default ES6 build with untranspiled ES6 module usage [[#15](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/15)]
  - This is pointed to by `jsnext:main` in project template `package.json` for use by tree-shaking ES6 bundlers.

**Fixed:**

- Added missing `main` config to React component/web module `package.json` templates, pointing at the ES5 build in `lib/`.
- Express middleware wasn't included in npm package.

**Changed:**

- 1.0.0 is now the default version for template projects.

# 0.3.1 / 2015-12-09

**Fixed:**

- Generic `nwb build` was broken for React components/web modules in 0.3.0.

# 0.3.0 / 2015-12-07

**Added:**

- Support for CSS preprocessor plugin packages [[#6](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/6)]
  - Loading of configuration objects exported by `'nwb-*'` dependencies found in `package.json`.
  - Creation of style loading pipelines for plugins which provide `cssPreprocessors` configuration.
    - [nwb-less](https://github.com/insin/nwb-less)
    - [nwb-sass](https://github.com/insin/nwb-sass)

**Fixed:**

- Babel config is now passed to Babel when transpiling modules [[#13](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/13)]

# 0.2.0 / 2015-12-05

**Added:**

- Express [middleware](https://github.com/insin/nwb/blob/master/docs/Middleware.md#middleware) for running a React app on your own development server using nwb's Webpack config generation [[#8](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/8)]

**Changed:**

- Webpack loader config objects are now merged with [webpack-merge](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge); query objects will now be deep merged, with lists occurring at the same position in build and user config being concatenated instead of overwritten.

**Fixed:**

- babel-runtime can now be resolved from nwb's dependencies when using `optional: ['runtime']` Babel config [[#10](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/10)]
- Paths to resources required from CSS in React app builds [[#9](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/9)]

# 0.1.0 / 2015-12-02

First 0.x release.
