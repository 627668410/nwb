These checks might help you diagnose whether something is wrong with nwb or your setup:

Is the version of `nwb` you're using installed globally or locally?

Which modules are installed in your project?

```
npm ls --depth=0
```

Try setting the `DEBUG` environment variable to `nwb` before running to check what generated configuration looks like:

```
# *nix
export DEBUG=nwb
# Windows
set DEBUG=nwb
```

If you need to prevent server commands from clearing scrollback so you can read any unexpected error logging which is happening, set the `NWB_TEST` environment variable to `true`:

```
# *nix
export NWB_TEST=true
# Windows
set NWB_TEST=true
```

Which versions of Node.js, npm and nwb are you using (if using it globally)?

```
node -v
npm -v
# If nwb is being used as a global install
nwb -v
```
-->
