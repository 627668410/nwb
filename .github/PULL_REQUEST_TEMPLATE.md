Are you using the appropriate branch?

`master` is used for bug fixes, documentation changes and any other changes which should be made available soon after being committed.

`next` is generally used for development of new features for the next major release and tracking dependency updates until then.

`webpack2` is being used for changes required to switch over to Webpack 2 once it's officially released. This branch gets rebased frequently.
